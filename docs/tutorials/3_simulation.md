# Tutorial 3: Simulation testing with dummy objects

The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with Autoware's planning simulator, which can be used for a variety of things such as validating vector maps (containing metadata about the road layout, traffic rules etc) and verifying Autoware's route planning functionality.

For this exercise, we will only need to use a single terminal window.

Before starting, please download and unpack the following files:
* [Tutorial 3 maps](https://drive.google.com/open?id=197kgRfSomZzaSbRrjWTx614le2qN-oxx)

> Note that these are the same files used in the [Planning Simulator quick launch exercise](../../README.md#planning-simulator)

## Run RViz and set initial and goal poses
1. Open a terminal window, navigate to the Autoware.IV install directory and run the following command:
   
```
source ./install/setup.bash
```

2. Run RViz with the following command:

```
roslaunch autoware_launch planning_simulator.launch vehicle_model:=lexus sensor_model:=aip_xx1 map_path:=/path/to/tutorial3_maps
```

1. Set the initial pose of the ego-vehicle
- Click “2D Pose estimate” button in the toolbar, or hit the “P” key

4. Set the goal pose of the ego-vehicle
- Click the “2D Nav Goal” button in the toolbar, or hit the “G” key

7. Add a dummy pedestrian
- Click the “2D Dummy Pedestrian” button in the toolbar, or hit the “L” key
![](images/ex3/toolbar_2D_dummy_pedestrian.png)
- Click and hold the left-mouse button, and then drag to set the direction of the pose

8. Make dummy pedestrians and dummy vehicles stationary, and add a stationary dummy vehicle
- In the [Tool Properties] panel in the lower-left, under [2D Dummy Car], set Velocity to 0
- Click the “2D Dummy Car” button
- Click and hold the left-mouse button, and then drag to set the direction of the pose
- In the [Tool Properties] panel in the lower-left, under [2D Dummy Pedestrian], set Velocity to 0

9. Remove all dummy objects
- Click “Delete All Objects” button in the toolbar, or hit the “D” key

## "Number One, Engage!"
10.  Adjust RViz viewpoint to ThirdPersonFollower to change from a top-down 2D view to a 3D view
- In the Views panel on the left side of the window, click the Type dropdown box and select "ThirdPersonFollower"
- Double-click the Target Frame value and select "base_link"
- Click the “Zero” button

11.  Use the Autoware Web UI to start the ego vehicle moving
- Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8085/autoware_web_controller (note that the web page may take a couple of minutes to appear)
![](images/ex3/autoware_web_ui.png)

- Under "Vehicle Engage”, click the "Engage" button
- Under “Autoware Engage: Connected”, click the “Engage” button
![](images/ex3/autoware_web_ui_engage.png)

- In the Web UI, Autoware State will change from "WaitingForEngage" to "Driving" and the ego-vehicle should now start moving along the route to the goal pose
